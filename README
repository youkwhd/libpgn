libpgn
======

FIDE PGN (Portable Game Notation) file manipulation.

NOTE: The library is in very early developement, so expect less
for the time being, I am still working to make this cross
platform to bsd, darwin, ms-dos, etc.

Although, support for gnu/linux is absolute.

Compiling the library
---------------------

    ./make

Usage
-----

This libray is meant to parse and manipulate PGN files, There's
very simple examples within the test/ folder, I'd recommend to
read the `test/pgn.c` file, as there would be the actual useful
functions.
