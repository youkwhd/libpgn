libpgn
======

FIDE Portable Game Notation (PGN) file manipulation.

Usage
-----

This libray is meant to parse and manipulate PGN files, There's
very simple examples within the test/ folder, I'd recommend to
read the `test/pgn.c` file, as there would be the actual useful
functions.

Build
-----

Compiling libpgn:

    make

Compile and run tests:

    make && ./test.sh
