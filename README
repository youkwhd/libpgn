libpgn
======

FIDE Portable Game Notation (PGN) file manipulation.

Usage
-----

This libray is meant to parse and manipulate PGN files, There's
very simple examples within the tests/ folder, I'd recommend to
read the `tests/pgn.c` file, as there would be the actual useful
functions.

Building
--------

Compiling libpgn:

    make

Examples
--------
    
Tiny Chess Sim in Ada - <https://github.com/youkwhd/szachy>,
