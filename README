libpgn
======

FIDE Portable Game Notation (PGN) file manipulation.

To start working with libpgn, peeking at tests/pgn.c file is a
great start.

Building
--------

Compiling libpgn:

    make

Tests
-----

To run tests, simply invoke:

    make test -s

Limitations
-----------

The parser is currently in-capable of parsing moves who has
alternatives and is more than one.

This is fine, it only has one alternative moves:

    1. e4 e5 (1. f4? e5! 2. g4?? Qh4#)

However, this is currently not possible:

    1. e4 e5 (1. f4? e5! 2. g4?? Qh4#) (1. e4 f6? 2. d4 g5?? 3. Qh5#)
