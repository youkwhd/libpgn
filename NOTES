The library uses a lot of dynamic arrays, rewriting each is
tedious and redundant. Maybe we can implement utils/array.c? I
am honestly not a fan of making abstraction, I know it's a data
structure that's being used dozens of time in libpgn, but
working with `void *` is never a good experience.

Is returing `int` for something that couldn't be minus ok? I am
thinking too much.
